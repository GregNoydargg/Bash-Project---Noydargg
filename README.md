# Bash-Project---Noydargg

## Instructions to this assignment: 

For this you need to have the email.txt file or create your own with the same name.
There will also be help instructions when ran that give an overall use and restate most information here. 

## About
This script is used to see valid and invalid emails. Due to phishing and other cyber related scam emails have become a key for hackers. This tool will scan for typos and accurate emails. This will then save it to a TXT file both labeled invalid and valid TXT files. I used some information from class and added more to the possible use case of this script.

## USE
To use, ./Main.sh and answer the prompt. If you have more emails or your own TXT follow the instructions above.
